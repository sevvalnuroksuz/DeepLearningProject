# 🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Classification Using Pre-trained CNN Models

This project focuses on classifying rice leaf diseases using deep learning and pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset includes 5932 images of diseased rice leaves, divided into the following four categories:

- Bacterial Blight 
- Blast
- Brown Spot 
- Tungro

## Objective

To build a multi-class image classification model that identifies the type of disease present in a rice leaf image using transfer learning techniques.

##  Models Used

The following pre-trained CNN architectures were used for evaluation:

1. **Xception**  
2. **VGG16**  
3. **MobileNet**  
4. **DenseNet121** 

All models were fine-tuned on the dataset, split into **80% training** and **20% testing**, with balanced data across all four classes.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

The performance of each model was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy* 
- **Precision* 
- **Recall*
- **F1-Score*
